# MiniProject

To run this code, you should be in a shell that has kallisto, bowtie2, and SPAdes. I would recommend being in the compbio (or compbio1) server because that is where the python wrapper was created. You will also need to upload the full repository, because there are a couple files in the repository needed to run the code.

The code will create a new directory called MiniProject_Delaney_Sauer. All of the subsequently created files, including the .log file named miniProjectLog.log, will be in that new directory.

As of right now, the Sleuth and BLAST portions of the code are not working.
